# AI-Hand-Gesture-Foundation
A real-time hand landmark detection system built using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. The project captures live video from a webcam and detects 21 hand keypoints with precise landmark connections. It demonstrates real-time computer vision processing and serves as a foundation for gesture recognition and human-computer interaction applications.
