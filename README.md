# AI-Hand-Gesture-Foundation
A real-time hand landmark detection system built using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. The project captures live video from a webcam and detects 21 hand keypoints with precise landmark connections. It demonstrates real-time computer vision processing and serves as a foundation for gesture recognition and human-computer interaction applications.
**Objective:**
# The goal of this project is to:
Detect and track hand landmarks in real time
Visualize 21 keypoints and their connections
Understand computer vision and landmark-based tracking
Build a base for gesture recognition systems
**Technologies Used:**
Python
OpenCV (for video capture and visualization)
MediaPipe (for hand landmark detection)
Conda Environment (for dependency management)
**How It Works:**
OpenCV captures live video from the webcam
Frames are converted from BGR to RGB
MediaPipe processes the frame
21 hand landmarks are detected
Landmarks and connections are drawn on the screen
Output is displayed in real time
**Key Features**:
Real-time hand tracking
21 precise 3D landmarks per hand
Multi-hand detection support
Lightweight and fast processing
Works with a standard webcam
**Applications:**
Gesture recognition systems
Finger counting applications
Virtual mouse control
Sign language detection
Human-computer interaction
**Installation:**
conda activate handenv
pip install mediapipe opencv-python
**How to Run:**
python hand.py
**Future Improvements:**
Gesture classification
Finger counting system
Custom gesture recognition
Integration with AI-based control systems
